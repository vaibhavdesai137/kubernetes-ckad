# Just like docker, k8s supports showing logs
#

#
# docker run -d nginx
#     753hft66
# docker logs 753hft66
#     ...
#     ...
#

#
# Since a pod can have multiple containers, we need to specify which container's logs we need.
# 
#   apiVersion: v1
#   kind: Pod
#   metadata:
#     name: my-pod
#   spec:
#     containers:
#       - name: my-container-1
#         image: foo
#       - name: my-container-2
#         image: bar
#
#   kubectl logs -f my-pod my-container-1
#   kubectl logs -f my-pod my-container-2
#
# If the pod has just 1 container, then the container name is optional.
