#
# Every k8s node needs cpu, mem and disk.
# Every pod needs the above resources to work.
# Based on the available resources on a node, the k8s scheduler decides where the pod should be placed.
# If no nodes match the resource requirements for a pod, k8s will not run the pod and the pod state would be PENDING.
#
# Resource Requests:
# By default, k8s assumes every container in a pod needs 0.5 cpu and 256 Mi mem.
# These are called resource requests.
# We can explicitly set the resource requests for our pod.
# If a scheduler cannot meet the resource requests for a container, the pod would enter the PENDING state.
#
# Resource Limits:
# Now, once a container is created, it can end up using all available resources (cpu, mem).
# This will cause starvation to other containers or even host processes.
# To avoid this, we can specify resource limits.
# By default, k8s set the container limit to 1 cpu and 512 Mi mem.
# Even with limits, a pod can end up using more mem.
# In such a case, k8s will TERMINATE the pod.
#
# resource request = bare minimum resources needed to start a container
# resource limit = maximum resources that a container is allowed to use
#

#
# CPU:
# CPU requests can go as low as "1m" (= 0.1) where "m" stands for milli.
# What does 1 cpu mean?
#   = 1 AWS vCPU
#   = 1 GCP Core
#   = 1 Azure Core
#   = 1 Hyperthread
#
# MEM:
# MEM can be requested in (G, M, K, Gi, Mi, Ki)
# What does 1 cpu mean?
#   = 1 AWS vCPU
#   = 1 GCP Core
#   = 1 Azure Core
#   = 1 Hyperthread
