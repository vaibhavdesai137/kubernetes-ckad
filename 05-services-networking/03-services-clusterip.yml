# ClusterIP:
#   - This type of service creates a VIP for a group of pods so that other objects can reach this group.
#   - This is great because the k8s objects can directly refer to this group via the VIP without worrying about indiviual running pods on that group.
#   - This service WILL NOT expose the pods to the outside world.
#   - Useful for internal communication only.
#   - For ex: backend pods connecting to DB pods via the ClusterIP created by DB pods.
